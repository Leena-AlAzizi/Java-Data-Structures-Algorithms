# Java Data Structures & Algorithms
A comprehensive collection of core computer science algorithms and data structures implemented in **Java**. This repository serves as a technical portfolio demonstrating proficiency in algorithmic logic, memory management, and problem-solving.

## Key Implementations
* **Graph Theory:** Dijkstra’s Shortest Path algorithm with adjacency matrix representation.
* **Advanced Data Structures:** Custom Priority Queue implementation using Linked Lists.
* **Recursion & Logic:** Branching recursion for finding maximum values and string manipulation (Palindrome checking).
* **Algorithm Analysis:** Focus on time and space complexity (Big O Notation).

## Tech Stack
* **Language:** Java .
* **Development Environment:** Eclipse IDE.

## Repository Structure
* `Main.java`: A centralized test bench to execute and validate all implementations.
